    <h1>Time Spent Online</h1>
    <p>What if a website showed you how much time you'd spent browsing it?</p>
    <p class="italic">2nd January, 2022</p>

      Dark mode please...

    <h2>Why not take a break?</h2>
    <p>The economy of the web is based on attention. The more time spent on a site, the more adverts shown, the more
      revenue earned.</p>
    <p>If time is so valuable, shouldn't we be considerate of how much time our visitors spend viewing our site?
      Perhaps we should remind our visitors to take a break now and again, similar to Wii Sports.</p>

    <p><a
        href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/random_did_you_know_wiis_why_not_take_a_break_screen_was_inspired_by_earthbound">According
        to NintendoLife</a>, this message was added by Nintendo's CEO, Satoru Iwata, after being inspired by
      Earthbound's "Two-hour Dad".</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Your dad calls you when you play for over two hours straight. He says, "Don't you think you
        should
        take a break now?"</span> - Yasuhiro Nagata</p>
    <p>Other games that tell players to take a break can be found <a
        href="https://www.giantbomb.com/take-a-break/3015-8255/games/">on Giantbomb</a>. This community sourced list
      has 23 titles, about half of which are produced by Nintendo. One web-based game amongst these titles is Cookie
      Clicker, so it's
      good to know a considerate web developer has already implemented this idea.</p>

    <p>I am astonished that YouTube never prompts the user to take a break, even when some addicted users
      have used their platform <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/48855182">up to 18 hours a day</a>. Did
      YouTube's data scientists notice these outliers? If so, how did
      they justify letting these users spend this much time on their platform?</p>
    <p>Thankfully, some time management tools have now been built into the YouTube app, helping proactive users manage
      time with daily limits and bedtime reminders. Sadly, these tools haven't been added to the YouTube website;
      perhaps the developers simply haven't found the time for this yet.</p>
    <p>How much would it impact YouTube's bottom line if they showed a message after two hours suggesting a break? How
      much could this nudge encourage users, especially those who care about how much time they spend online, to develop
      healthy internet habits?</p>
    <h2>Net Art Concepts</h2>
    <p>The participant attempts to relax, watching videos or scrolling through social media, while half their screen is
      filled with a timer progressively getting larger. A
      ticking sound plays in the background. An important question to contemplate: "Is this artwork really
      worth my time?" <span class="italic">Browser Extension</span></p>
    <p>After two hours, the net art website you're viewing automatically redirects you to support materials for internet
      addiction; it also remembers that you are barred and kicks you out when you try to visit the website again. <span
        class="italic">Website</span></p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I think there should be a balance between being aware of time and being distracted by a timer. In any case, I've
      provided the option to show / hide this site's timer, so we are reminded to value our time, but we can choose
      how much to get stressed out about it.</p>
    <p>A timer that shows each second implies each second must be useful; this, combined with
      our cultural ideals surrounding productivity and effective use of time, makes for an effective background
      anxiety generator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online, we are used to recieving information and stories as quickly as possible. A second-by-second timer might
      fit quite well on social media sites, especially TikTok and other infinite scrollers. In this website however, the
      timer challenges you to remain invested in what you are reading;
      <!--will it be worth the effort?--> all the while,
      precious
      seconds
      are
      ticking
      away.
